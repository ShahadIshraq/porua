NOTE: This directory needs icon.icns and icon.ico files for full platform support.

Generate these files by running:
    cd wrapper
    ./scripts/generate-icons.sh

Or see wrapper/src-tauri/icons/README.md for manual generation instructions.

For development, the build will work with just PNG files, but production builds
should include proper .icns (macOS) and .ico (Windows) files.
