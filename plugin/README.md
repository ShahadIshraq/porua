## Building for Production

### Create Distribution Packages

```bash
npm run package          # Create both Chrome and Firefox packages
npm run package:chrome   # Create Chrome package only
npm run package:firefox  # Create Firefox package only
npm run release          # Build + package in one command
```

Packages are created in the `packages/` directory:
- `tts-reader-chrome-v{version}.zip` - Chrome Web Store package
- `tts-reader-firefox-v{version}.zip` - Firefox Add-ons package
- `tts-reader-source-v{version}.zip` - Source code archive (for Firefox review)

### Package Contents

Both packages include:
- `dist/` - Bundled and minified JavaScript
- `icons/` - Extension icons
- `popup.html` - Settings popup
- `src/styles/` - CSS stylesheets
- `manifest.json` - Browser-specific manifest

### Submission Guidelines

#### Chrome Web Store
1. Run `npm run package:chrome`
2. Upload `tts-reader-chrome-v{version}.zip` to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
3. Follow the submission wizard

#### Firefox Add-ons (AMO)
1. Run `npm run package:firefox`
2. Upload both:
   - `tts-reader-firefox-v{version}.zip` (extension package)

### Validation

Before packaging, the build script validates:
- All required files exist (manifests, icons, built JavaScript)
- Production build completes successfully
- Package sizes are reasonable

After packaging, test in both browsers:
- Chrome: Load unpacked extension from root directory
- Firefox: Load temporary add-on from root directory
