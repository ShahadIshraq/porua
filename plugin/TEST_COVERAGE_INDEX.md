## Quick Navigation

### By Priority

**Priority 1: Critical (0% coverage)**
- Logger.js - See section 1 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- SkipControl.js - See section 2 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- PlaybackSessionManager.js - See section 8 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

**Priority 2: Very Low Coverage (<50%)**
- AudioCacheManager.js - See section 3 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- PersistentCache.js - See section 4 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- WarmCache.js - See section 5 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

**Priority 3: Needs Expansion**
- AudioPlayer.js - See section 6 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- AudioRegistry.js - See section 7 in TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

### By Time Investment

**Quick (< 1 hour)**
- Logger.js - 30 min, EASY

**Medium (1-2 hours)**
- SkipControl.js - 1-2h, EASY
- AudioCacheManager.js - 1.5-2h, MEDIUM (depends on PersistentCache)

**Substantial (2-3 hours)**
- PersistentCache.js - 2-3h, MEDIUM
- AudioPlayer expansion - 1-2h, MEDIUM
- AudioRegistry expansion - 1-2h, MEDIUM

**Major (4-6 hours)**
- PlaybackSessionManager.js - 4-6h, HARD
- WarmCache.js - 1.5-2h, MEDIUM

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2 hours)
Logger.js + SkipControl.js
- Impact: +0.35% coverage
- Difficulty: EASY
- Can start immediately

### Phase 2: Cache Layer (5 hours)
AudioCacheManager + PersistentCache + WarmCache
- Impact: +0.92% coverage
- Difficulty: MEDIUM
- Requires Phase 1 knowledge

### Phase 3: Playback Logic (3 hours)
AudioPlayer + AudioRegistry expansions
- Impact: +0.46% coverage
- Difficulty: MEDIUM
- Parallel with Phase 2

### Phase 4: Session Controller (6 hours)
PlaybackSessionManager
- Impact: +0.77% coverage
- Difficulty: HARD
- Requires Phase 2 completion

**Expected result: 80-80.5% coverage**

## Testing Technologies

### Framework & Tools
- **Test Framework:** Vitest
- **Mocking:** vi.mock(), vi.spyOn()
- **DOM Simulation:** jsdom (built into vitest)
- **Assertions:** expect()

### Mock Patterns

**For console-based code (Logger):**
```javascript
vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(vi.fn());
vi.spyOn(console, 'warn').mockImplementation(vi.fn());
```

**For DOM components (SkipControl):**
```javascript
const mockContainer = document.createElement('div');
// Vitest + jsdom provides full DOM API
```

**For IndexedDB (PersistentCache, WarmCache):**
```javascript
vi.mock('idb', () => ({
  openDB: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({
    /* mock IndexedDB API */
  }))
}));
```

See TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for complete mock templates.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific file
npm test Logger.test.js

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Check specific file coverage
npm test -- --coverage --coverage-include="src/popup/SkipControl.js"
```
